- 👋 Hi, I’m @Jessicanguyenn81
I like to code and help build tools and sites that will **make a difference** 

I am a purpose-driven software engineer who thrives on helping others and creating a positive environment for those around me. 
I love working with a team and collaborating together around a common goal for optimal program development.

I am passionate about making a difference and I look forward to designing products that are both inclusive and meaningful.
